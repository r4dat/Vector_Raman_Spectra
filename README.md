# Vector_Raman_Spectra
Cleaning Raman spectra by deep learning Auto-Encoder

High and super-resolution spectra are useful in emerging areas of biological sample identification via Raman Spectroscopy - such as non-destructively detecting cancer in a cell biopsy. Here we use a convolution auto-encoder with skip connections to denoise and deconvolve (sharpen) Raman spectra.
